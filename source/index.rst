This site explores some "toy models", i.e. highly idealized analytic models, of atmospheric phenomena. Toy models are useful for building understanding and generating novel hypotheses, not for issuing whether forecasts.

The models are coded up in Python, and are presented interactively in your browser using `pyscript`_.

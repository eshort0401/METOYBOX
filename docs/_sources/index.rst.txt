Meteorological Toybox
=======================================

Welcome to the Meteorological Toybox! This site exists to share and discuss some of the idealized toy models I came across while working as an atmospheric scientist. Currently the site is limited to just linear inertia-gravity wave based models, but eventually I would like to include content on general circulation models, Rossby and and edge wave models, equatorial wave models, and density current based models. Some of the models on this site were put together for contract work, so I cannot yet openly share all the code and maths, but should be able to a few years from now.

Meteorological Toybox
=======================================

Welcome to the Meteorological Toybox! This site explores some "toy models", i.e. highly idealized analytic models, of atmospheric phenomena. The main goal of this site is to expose the beauty of idealized mathematical models.

The models on this site have been coded up in Python, and are presented interactively in your browser using `pyscript`_. Chrome is the recommended browser, noting the models are particularly slow to interactive with in Firefox.
